Prototype Updates & Stand-out Features -

Feature 1: TIME MANIPULATION
- Updated Status: Live & Functional 
- We have now successfully integrated the Time Manipulation feature into our Orrery Web App.
- By default, the Orrery is set to demonstrate real-time Orbital Trajectories, Positions and Motion of the Celestial Bodies.
- With the added Time Manipulation feature, users can now Speed Up/Slow Down the Orrery using intuitive speed control options.
- The Orrery can be Sped Up/Slowed Down up to 5 years/second (Including, 1 hr/sec, 1 day/sec, 20 days/sec, 100 days/sec & 1 year/sec).
- This allows for a fascinating simulation of the Solar System if it were moving with a different speed than it does.
