Prototype Updates & Stand-out Features -

Feature 1: TIME MANIPULATION
- Current Status: Live & Functional 
- We have now successfully integrated the Time Manipulation feature into our Orrery Web App.
- By default, the Orrery is set to demonstrate real-time Orbital Trajectories, Positions and Motion of the Celestial Bodies.
- With the added Time Manipulation feature, users can now Speed Up/Slow Down the Orrery using intuitive speed control options.
- The Orrery can be Sped Up/Slowed Down up to 5 years/second (Including, 1 hr/sec, 1 day/sec, 20 days/sec, 100 days/sec & 1 year/sec).
- This allows for a fascinating simulation of the Solar System if it were moving with a different speed than it does.

Feature 2: SET GEOLOCATION
- Current Status: Live & Functional
- Our Orrery web app adjusts and displays all the Keplerian parameters for Celestial
bodies relative to the User’s Current Location.
- Additionally, we have configured a feature through which you can view these
parameters with respect to any set of Longitude & Latitude. This feature can be
accessed in the “Set Time & Geolocation” section of the side panel (Use decimal
degrees for Latitude/Longitude & Negative values for those of West or South).
- This feature lets you explore the solar system & its ever changing nature from the
perspective of a user sitting in any other part of the world.

Feature 3: SET TIME
- Current Status: Live & Functional
- By default, the Orrery is set to demonstrate real-time Orbital Trajectories, Positions
and Motion of the Celestial Bodies.
- With the Set Time option, users can now set the Orrery to anytime between 9999
BC & 9999 AD.
- This will allow users to explore the state of the Celestial bodies at any given time in
Future and in the Past.
- You can set the Year, Date, Month & even a particular Time to view the exact
parameters of the Astronomical bodies
